// ATTEMPT #1
// APPROACH:
// As usual, don't over complicate things, if you remember your middle school Math
// #1 get the difference of two points ## points[i+1] - points[i]
// #2 take the higher number (because that's the max time you'll take)
// #3 Math.abs if it's negative, because negative means you're moving downwards/left (think graphs)
// #4 Add them together et viol√†
